Section 7.1.4 states:

Any invocation of a library function that is implemented as a macro shall expand
to code that evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully protected by
parentheses where necessary, so it is generally safe to use arbitrary
expressions as arguments.

#define islower(c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')

evaluates 'c' twice so an expression such as c++ will fail if the value of c is 'z'.
